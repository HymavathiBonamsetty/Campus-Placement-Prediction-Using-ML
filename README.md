# Campus-Placement-Prediction-Using-ML
The campus placement prediction system that utilizes machine learning (ML) algorithms, 
including linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), 
decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. The existing system incorporates features 
such as name, age, percentage, and work experience to predict the likelihood of a student getting 
placed. The proposed system enhances the prediction accuracy by incorporating additional 
features such as programming skills, communication skills, participation in hackathons etc. 
Through the implementation of these ML algorithms, the system analyzes the provided features 
and predicts the probability of campus placement for a student. Experimental results demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the proposed system, with significantly improved prediction accuracy 
compared to the existing system. The outcomes of this study highlight the potential of ML 
algorithms in predicting campus placements and provide valuable insights for educational 
institutions and students.

### Various Classification Algorithms: 
Classification algorithms are widely used in machine learning to categorize or predict the class or 
category of a given input. Here are some popular types of classification algorithms: 
1. Logistic Regression: A linear algorithm that models the relationship between the input 
features and the probability of belonging to a particular class. 
2. Decision Trees: These algorithms create a tree-like model of decisions and their possible 
consequences. They split the data based on different features and create a hierarchical 
structure to classify instances. 
3. Random Forest: A collection of decision trees where each tree predicts the class, and the 
final class is determined by voting or averaging the predictions of all trees. It helps to 
reduce over fitting and improve accuracy. 
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes 
in a high-dimensional space, which can be used for classification. It aims to find the best 
separating line or surface that maximally separates the data into different classes. 
5. Naive Bayes: A probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, assuming 
independence among the features. It calculates the probability of each class and assigns 
the class with the highest probability.
