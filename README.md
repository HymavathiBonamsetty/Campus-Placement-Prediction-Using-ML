# Campus-Placement-Prediction-Using-ML
The campus placement prediction system that utilizes machine learning (ML) algorithms, 
including linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), 
decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. The existing system incorporates features 
such as name, age, percentage, and work experience to predict the likelihood of a student getting 
placed. The proposed system enhances the prediction accuracy by incorporating additional 
features such as programming skills, communication skills, participation in hackathons etc. 
Through the implementation of these ML algorithms, the system analyzes the provided features 
and predicts the probability of campus placement for a student. Experimental results demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the proposed system, with significantly improved prediction accuracy 
compared to the existing system. The outcomes of this study highlight the potential of ML 
algorithms in predicting campus placements and provide valuable insights for educational 
institutions and students.
